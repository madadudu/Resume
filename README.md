Bootstrap 4 "Blog" Website (React & Angular) 
Link: https://junhua-bootstrap-4-react-angular-app.netlify.app/home 
•	The project was designed with the latest user interface design and API implementation.
•	The major feature of this website is to enable the creation, modification and deletion of blog posts using with a UI within the app. 
•	Using Angular for development and prototyping of a useable and scalable Blogging system.
•	Website contains a back-end API to manage the blog posts in MongoDB Atlas database as well as wire up the application to use a single service to manage the data and it will also enable users to view more than a single blog post by clicking on it from the main "blog" page.

Client-Server RMI (Java)
•	This project was designed to provide RMI in Java and includes concepts such as Networking, RMI, and Serialization.
•	By using Networking in Java, a mechanism was created to establish a distributed application.
•	RMI allows the client to invoke methods on an RMI server running in another JVM.
•	Converting the objects to a byte stream and reverted into a copy of the object in the server by using Serialization.

Multi-Activities App (Java)
•	This project was made to handle Multi-Threaded programming in Java and includes concepts such as Threads, Guarded Blocks, and Synchronization.
•	The app can run a single process in less time because the guarded blocks secure the process can be continued and distinguish the result without catching other threads.
•	Synchronization provides production support, participating in testing within the project cycle, all blocks are synchronized on the same object and have only one thread executing inside them at a time.

Live Tracking App (React) 
Link: https://junhua-covid-19-tracker-react-app.netlify.app/ 
•	This project was created using the most modern JavaScript syntax and includes Material UI, Charts.js, React Hooks, and API data fetching.
•	The project was fetched with the live data from the API using Async and Await syntax, showing the statistics in the Cards and the Charts.
•	The project also shows different cases from different components with live date by using React Hooks.
